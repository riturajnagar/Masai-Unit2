        <h1>  b tag  </h1>
        <p>The HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>
        
        <h1>  i tag  </h1>
        <p>The HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the naming of this element.</p>
        
        <h1> u tag </h1>
        <p>The HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
        <p> <b>Note :-</b>This element used to be called the "Underline" element in older versions of HTML, and is still sometimes misused in this way. To underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes the CSS text-decoration property set to underline. </p>

        <h1> select tag </h1>
        <p> The HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.<br><br>
            <b>The select element is used to create a drop-down list.</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.</li>
                    <li>The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).</li>
                    <li>The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.</li>
                    <li>The option tags inside the select element define the available options in the drop-down list.</li>
                </ul>            
        </p>
        <h1> button tag </h1>
        <p>
            The HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
            By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS. <br>
            Inside a button element you can put text (and tags like i, b, strong, br, img, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the input element!
